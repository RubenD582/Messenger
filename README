# Project Setup

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure that the following software is installed on your machine:
- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git (if cloning from GitHub)

## Setting up the project
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install Dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the services using Docker
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will start all required services (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Zookeeper, and the database migration service)

## Database Management
All database migrations are automatically run by the knex service in Docker.

### Manual migration commands (if needed)
If you need to run migrations manually:

1. Run migration
   ```
   docker-compose run --rm knex migrate:latest --env development
   ```

2. Roll back migration
   ```
   docker-compose run --rm knex migrate:rollback --env development
   ```

## Stopping the services
```
docker-compose down
```

## Development
For development with hot reloading, you can run:
```
npm run dev
```
